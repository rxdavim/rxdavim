### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:evergreen_tree: I am a Forestry and Natural Resources PhD student which main research interests are fire ecology and management with special focus on prescribed fire, fire behaviour and pyrogeography. My work is supported by FCT, IP. and hosted at CEF/ISA, University of Lisbon.

:fire: I am a volunteer firefigher and certified for planning, preparing, executing and evaluating prescribed burning but also tactical fire operations. 

I am currently working on prescribed burning and wildfire interaction using diverse spatial data and statistical analysis to address fire-fuel relationships in Portugal.
