:evergreen_tree: I am a Forestry and Natural Resources PhD student which main research interests are fire ecology and management with special focus on prescribed fire, fire behaviour and pyrogeography. My work is :moneybag: supported by FCT, and  :mailbox_closed: hosted at CEF/ISA, University of Lisbon.

:fire: I am a volunteer firefigher and certified for planning, preparing, executing and evaluating prescribed burning but also tactical fire operations. 

:computer: I am currently working on prescribed burning and wildfire interaction using diverse spatial data and statistical analysis to address fire-fuel relationships in Portugal.
